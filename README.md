MongoDB Atlas 

1. Database Structure: MongoDB Atlas is a NoSQL database, so understanding document-based data modeling is essential. Setting up collections and fields required thinking about data organization to ensure query efficiency and scalability.
2. Interface and Usability
Interface: The web-based Atlas interface is visually appealing, with an organized layout that guides the user through data import, query creation, and monitoring.
Usability: It’s well-suited for handling unstructured or semi-structured data typical in healthcare records, with flexible schema changes. Querying is done using MongoDB’s query language, which can be challenging for those new to NoSQL but becomes efficient with practice.


Redis cloud 
Configuartion and Setup 
1. created an account and set up the cloud requirements
2. data ingestion by making primary key value and storing data in key pair formatinh
3. Interface: Redis Cloud’s UI is simple but functional. It doesn’t have the same graphical tools as BigQuery or MongoDB Atlas, but its CLI and API support provide flexibility.
Usability: Redis is highly performant for real-time data and caching but can be challenging for complex data analysis. It’s best suited for fast, read-heavy workloads rather than in-depth data exploration typical in healthcare analytics. The lack of a relational model means you have to design key structures carefully to simulate relationships.
